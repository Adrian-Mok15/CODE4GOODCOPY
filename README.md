# team-13

We are Team 13 for the JPMorgan code for <good> 2022 Hackathon. We built a project in 24 hrs. 😁

 ## Prompt:

How can technology impact what this connection and engagement looks like in the future once participants age out of the program? 
Consider how to engage future alumni, track successes, share stories, and incentivize alumni to stay connected.


First Goal:

Build a alumni network web app that allows alumni to create events and get together. This allows alumni to feel connected to their communities and also gives the the satisfaction of giving back to the program that helped contribute to their success. 



Second Goal:

We also want to take care of our alumnus as a way to keep them within the community. Alumnus are those who finished with these programs and are looking for jobs. Our main way of incentivizing alumnus to stay within the community is to create an outlet for these alumnus to be hired through Jream. The idea is that these alumnus gained real world teaching experience and showed that they are a an involved member of this community. The skills they gained should be marketable and companies should trust the quality of people that graduate from Jreams.


## What We Built:

* React + JS
* Material UI
* AWS
* MongoDB

The webapp we created facilitates creating group events and makes details about said events more available. We used google maps API for locational data tied in with personal contact info to allow users to communicate with others in Jream to organize smaller sports events and tutoring sessions. Any user can have searchable flags such as “Tutor for math” or “Looking for soccer teammates” that connects the community in way better than word of mouth. 

Recruiters that trust Jream can set up career fair events that solely target our talented alumnus. Furthermore, they can access a page with all the alumnus who are looking for employment along with their interests. Allowing recruiters to get in contact with promising youth will both bring in new talents who were previously not a part of dream, as well as encourage alumni to stay within the community and participate in events
